        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>Most people today have used the Internet in one form or another in their daily life. Mobile and desktop devices alike have become ubiquitous. 
            However, thirty years ago the Internet was only just beginning to hit its stride, and when the web was first developed, it was largely inaccessible&mdash;and 
            unknown&mdash;to the average person. It was developed for, and used for, solely academic and research purposes. Web browsers would play an essential role in 
            bringing the Internet to the general public. A web browser is responsible for initiating a connection with a web server, where it receives an HTML document 
            that contains the information on the web page a user requests. The browser then interprets the HTML document and displays the contents to the end user in a 
            visual format [1]. More than simply sending and receiving data, web browsers function as an easy-to-use, graphics-based interface that makes the act of 
            navigating the Internet an effortless process.</p>
        <p>In the 30-year timespan that web browsers have existed, they have progressed from simple, text-based command line interface programs to robust, 
            graphics-based applications capable of everything from playing videos to online games. Critical inventions like TCP are responsible for the web 
            existing at all, but without web browsers, the web would likely have remained simply as an information retrieval tool for research and academic facilities. 
            So many aspects of day-to-day life are now conducted over the web&mdash;communication, finances, medicine, entertainment. Access to the web is still at risk of being 
            monopolized, since without using a web browser, most users have no way of accessing the web at all. However, the formation of the W3C and the continued development 
            of browser alternatives such as Firefox, Edge, Safari, and Opera maintain access to the web for the average person. </p>
