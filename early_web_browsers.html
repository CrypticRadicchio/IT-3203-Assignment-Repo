        <h2>Designing the Earliest Web Browsers</h2>
        
        <h3>Precursors to Modern Browsers</h3>
        <p>Prior to the invention of the first true web browser, numerous precursors were cropping up during the 1980’s as developers sought a way for web users 
            who lacked technical skill to easily access and use computer networks <a href="references.html#ref3">[3]</a>. 
            <br><br>These forerunners to modern web browsers lacked a robust graphical user 
            interface (GUI). They were line-mode browsers, meaning they could only display text and hypertext in a command line interface (CLI). However, they 
            had many of the same capabilities as today’s browsers—namely the ability to index and search documents on the web and view and navigate the contents 
            of those documents—but they also possessed more advanced features such as narrowing the scope of a search by tag attributes <a href="references.html#ref3">[3]</a>.
            <br><br> Although these early 
            browsers were fairly robust, particularly given the reduced size of the web at the time, using their features to the fullest required a good understanding 
            of how both the browser and the network functioned, restricting access from the average person <a href="references.html#ref3">[3]</a>.</p>
        
        <h4>The Invention of Hypertext</h4>
        <p>Hypertext links sections of information together. Although the concept of hypertext has existed for far longer than computers have even existed, it was not until
             the 1940s that researchers began to consider how to apply this concept to information retrieval systems <a href="references.html#ref13">[13]</a>.</p>
        <p>As the first line-mode browsers were developed, a need for a convenient way to connect pieces of information 
        quickly arose. Adding a hyperlink on a word or phrase allowed the user to jump from one page to another, following a trail of information. However, since line-mode 
        browsers lacked a GUI, visualizing how pages were linked together could become difficult, as well as remembering the order in which the user traversed them. There 
        was also the issue of how to facilitate editing and updating the text displayed on a page and ensuring the user encountered the most up-to-date version. For these 
        purposes, a variety of hypertext systems were created <a href="references.html#ref13">[13]</a>.</p>
        <p>Some early hypertext systems included the following; elements of these systems are still used in modern browsers today <a href="references.html#ref13">[13]</a>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hypertext Editing System (HES):</strong> Links text unidirectionally, allowing boilerplate text to be edited on one page and the updates to display on 
            multiple other pages without allowing the user to navigate to the original page</li>
            <li><strong>Guide: </strong>Replaces the anchor text (the link) with different content, allowing various elements like pop-up windows, citation references, 
            and expanding/collapsing sections of text</li>
            <li><strong>HyperCard: </strong>Displays pages as a series of cards, making the mental process of locating and traversing through sections of information much simpler</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h4>Adding HTML</h4>
        <p>Webpages are defined using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) which outlines all of the elements of a page. HTML was invented in 1990, and at this time HTML elements 
        were simplistic: mainly text, numbered lists, and of course hypertext links. When HTML was initially introduced to the already-established hypertext community, it 
        was not well received due to its lack of robust error handling. Using this feedback, HTML continued to develop, becoming gradually more robust and more capable of handling 
        complicated elements like text styles and eventually multimedia <a href="references.html#ref13">[13]</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>The First Web Browsers</h3>
        <p>In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee invented the first true web browser at CERN. It was called WorldWideWeb, not to be confused with "World Wide Web", which referred to the web as a whole.
            WorldWideWeb was also known as Nexus, and it provided a graphical user interface. 
            WorldWideWeb was capable of interpreting CSS stylesheets, allowing for stylized webpages with differing fonts and text sizes <a href="references.html#ref3">[3]</a>. Notably, this browser still 
            did not display elements in color due to the fact that the machine it was originally designed on, a NeXT computer, was in grayscale <a href="references.html#ref3">[3]</a>.
            <br><br> Although it did not 
            display images inline like browsers do today, WorldWideWeb could download and display images in a separate window. This ability to keep open multiple windows 
            simultaneously, along with its point-and-click graphical user interface, demonstrated for the first time the power and ease of access a graphics-based web browser 
            could provide <a href="references.html#ref3">[3]</a>.</p>
        <p>Other browser projects were developed with increasing GUI capabilities, such as Erwise for Unix in 1992 and Cello for Windows in 1993, but it quickly became 
            apparent that for the web to become widely adopted, it needed a browser with a robust, easy-to-use GUI that could be used by any user regardless of technical 
            skill and on any operating system <a href="references.html#ref3">[3]</a>.</p>
