        <h2>Designing the Earliest Web Browsers</h2>
        
        <h3>Precursors to Modern Browsers</h3>
        <p>Prior to the invention of the first true web browser, numerous precursors were cropping up during the 1980’s as developers sought a way for web users 
            who lacked technical skill to easily access and use computer networks [2]. These forerunners to modern web browsers lacked a robust graphical user 
            interface (GUI). They were line-mode browsers, meaning they could only display text and hypertext in a command line interface (CLI). However, they 
            had many of the same capabilities as today’s browsers—namely the ability to index and search documents on the web and view and navigate the contents 
            of those documents—but they also possessed more advanced features such as narrowing the scope of a search by tag attributes [2]. Although these early 
            browsers were fairly robust, particularly given the reduced size of the web at the time, using their features to the fullest required a good understanding 
            of how both the browser and the network functioned, restricting access from the average person [2].</p>
        
        <h3>The First Web Browsers</h3>
        <p>In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee invented the first true web browser. It was called WorldWideWeb, also known as Nexus, and provided a graphical user interface. 
            WorldWideWeb was capable of interpreting stylesheets, allowing for stylized webpages with differing fonts and text sizes [2]. Notably, this browser still 
            did not display elements in color due to the fact that the machine it was originally designed on, a NeXT computer, was in grayscale [3]. Although it did not 
            display images inline like browsers do today, WorldWideWeb could download and display images in a separate window. This ability to keep open multiple windows 
            simultaneously, along with its point-and-click graphical user interface, demonstrated for the first time the power and ease of access a graphics-based web browser 
            could provide [3].</p>
        <p>Other browser projects were developed with increasing GUI capabilities, such as Erwise for Unix in 1992 and Cello for Windows in 1993, but it quickly became 
            apparent that for the web to become widely adopted, it needed a browser with a robust, easy-to-use GUI that could be used by any user regardless of technical 
            skill and on any operating system [2]. </p>
