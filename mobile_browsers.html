        <h2>Developing Browsers for Mobile Devices</h2>
        <p>Smartphones and mobile devices had a major impact on web usage when they became ubiquitous around 2010. At this point, 
            the web was used by the majority of people, and the ability to access it anywhere at any time only increased that usage. 
            However, most existing web browsers were not yet available for non-desktop devices. This meant developers had to start over again with designing a 
            brand-new browser that could function on early smart devices. Early mobile devices had extremely limited connection speeds and small viewports, meaning 
            correctly loading and displaying webpages designed for desktop screens was tedious and often impossible [9]. The first mobile browser was Openwave, 
            which was based on the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), but due to its slow connection speeds, was phased out in favor of newer protocols [9].</p>
        <p>Eventually, mobile web browsers achieved most of the features desktop browsers offer. In most locations, mobile connection speeds have increased to the point that even poorly 
            optimized webpages load reasonably quickly. However, there remains a common issue of many webpages not possessing a design conducive to being displayed in a browser 
            with a limited viewport [10].</p>
