        <h2>Developing Browsers for Mobile Devices</h2>
        <p>Smartphones and mobile devices had a major impact on web usage when they became ubiquitous around 2010. At this point, 
            the web was used by the majority of people, and the ability to access it anywhere at any time only increased that usage. 
            However, most existing web browsers were not yet available for non-desktop devices. This meant developers had to start over again with designing a 
            brand-new browser that could function on early smart devices. Early mobile devices had extremely limited connection speeds and small viewports, meaning 
            correctly loading and displaying webpages designed for desktop screens was tedious and often impossible [9]. The first mobile browser was Openwave, 
            which was based on the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), but due to its slow connection speeds, was phased out in favor of newer protocols [9].</p>
        <p>Eventually, mobile web browsers achieved most of the features desktop browsers offer. In most locations, mobile connection speeds have increased to the point that even poorly 
            optimized webpages load reasonably quickly. However, there remains a common issue of many webpages not possessing a design conducive to being displayed in a browser 
            with a limited viewport [10].</p>
        
        <h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
        <p>By 2013, mobile device usage was skyrocketing. Nearly a third of search engine queries were occuring on mobile devices, a percentage that would eventually
         increase to more than 60% in less than ten years [11]. With such a significant share of users accessing websites from devices with much smaller screens than 
        the typical desktop, the need for a new style of web design that was tailored to mobile users was rapidly arising. Most existing websites had well-designed layouts
         for desktop resolutions and could handle the relatively small degree of difference between differently-sized laptop and desktop monitor screens, but the difference
         in resolution between a smartphone and computer was nearly a perfect inversion. Whereas a collection of images on a computer screen could be neatly displayed in 
        a handful of tidy rows or columns, this layout would be all but destroyed when viewed on a smartphone.</p>
        <p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) established the groundwork 
        for responsive web design by introducing media queries. This addition to CSS allowed web designers to fluidly adjust sections of a webpage to better fit specific 
        resolutions. Not only could they change the size of content sections, they could completely rearrange, add, and remove content as well as altering their visual style. 
        Adopting responsive web design principles allowed existing websites to simply adjust their website content to meet the needs of their end users rather than investing 
        resources in creating an entirely separate copy of the website for every major screen resolution category. Media queries were quickly supported by all major web browsers 
        and have near-ubiquitous support today [12].</p>
