        <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web Accessibility:</strong> Early web browsers were largely inaccessible to the average person because they lacked a robust graphical user interface, 
            meaning the user would be required to have strong computer literacy skills to carry out basic tasks with the browser, and therefore developing an easy-to-use browser 
                application became a top priority</li>
            <li><strong>The Importance of Graphics:</strong> Webpages became much more popular after browsers became capable of displaying images in-line, which allowed webpages 
            to involve more graphical elements and less text&mdash;this made it possible to have websites for commercial purposes</li>
            <li><strong>Market Monopolies:</strong> Different companies, like Microsoft and Mozilla, have competed to secure the largest market share in web browsers ever since 
                browsers emerged from solely academic spheres into the general public consciousness; today, the strongest competitors include Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox</li>
            <li><strong>Operating System Influences:</strong> The explosive popularity of dominant operating systems like Windows and Macintosh in the early 2000s heavily influenced
             the usage of different web browsers as they were often packaged together and users became used to using the most readily-available option</li>
            <li><strong>Evolving Needs:</strong> With the invention and near-immediate ubiquity of mobile devices, development efforts quickly turned to creating streamlined web 
            browsers designed for the more limited processors of smartphones</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Web Design:</strong> As the ratio of mobile site visitors increased, media queries and new design principles were established to improve the 
            user experience without rebuilding each website from scratch</li>
        </ul>
