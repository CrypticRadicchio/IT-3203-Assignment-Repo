        <h2>Mainstream Adoption and the First Browser War</h2>
        
        <h3>Bringing the Web to the Average User</h3>
        <p>Around the early- to mid-90’s, the web was seeing significant usage, but still primarily from those in academic or research settings. 
            The catalyst for the beginning of the web’s wider adoption was NCSA Mosaic, a GUI-based browser originally developed for Unix in 1993 <a href="references.html#ref3">[3]</a>. 
            <br><br>Unlike its recent predecessors, Mosaic displayed images inline, allowing webpages to involve more graphics as part of their core design and be less text-based. 
            Even better, users could download a single file with which to install Mosaic, making it much easier to obtain and use <a href="references.html#ref13">[13]</a>.
            Furthermore, Mosaic was quickly ported to Windows, which was the more popular operating systems choice for non-technical users due to its overall user-friendliness.<p>
        <p>With the average person now having access to a user-friendly web browser on top of a user-friendly operating system, the web experienced an enormous surge of popularity 
        thanks to Mosaic. Mosaic is considered to be one of the 1990’s “killer applications”—a pivotal piece of software with significant impact on society and subsequent 
        inventions—and was the basis on which later browsers were built upon <a href="references.html#ref3">[3]</a>. 
        <br><br>By 1994, Mosaic had attracted 2 million users and was gaining 150,000 additional users every month.
        Although the widespread adoption of Mosaic resulted in NeXT's concept of navigating and editing webpages in-browser, it helped boost the World Wide Web's usage throughout
         the academic community <a href="references.html#ref13">[13]</a>.
        Over the next few years, several competing browsers were developed, most notably Netscape’s Navigator in 1994 and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer in 1995.</p>
        
        <h3>The First Browser War</h3>
        <p>As more browser products became available to the general market, the internet gradually became more commercialized. Netscape and Microsoft rapidly took the lead 
            as the main competitors in what would later be known as the first browser war. <br><br>Their respective products, Navigator and Internet Explorer, provided mostly the 
            same features and introduced support for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for the first time <a href="references.html#ref4">[4]</a>. 
            During this period, both companies fiercely competed with each other, 
            going as far as to pull publicity stunts to disparage their competition <a href="references.html#ref5">[5]</a>. 
            <br><br>At first, Netscape obtained the largest market share, but over the next ten years as 
            Microsoft began packaging Internet Explorer into its Windows releases, Microsoft eventually secured 99% of the browser market. Microsoft’s monopoly on the market 
            forced Netscape to pivot, creating Mozilla, which would later lead to the development of Mozilla Firefox <a href="references.html#ref4">[4]</a>. </p>
        
        <h4>The Web Reaches Everyone</h4>
        <p>By the end of the 1990s, computers were becoming commonplace in the average family home, and with them web browsers. Here are the top 5 countries ranked by 
        the percent of their population using the web in 1999 <a href="references.html#ref13">[13]</a>:</p>

        <h3>The World Wide Web Consortium</h3>
        <p>The increasing competition between so many distinct products was problematic for web users due to each browser using their own versions of HTML and introducing new features 
            that did not necessarily exist in other browsers. <br><br>While this allowed browsers to stay ahead of one another in the competition, it meant that a webpage that displayed 
            correctly on one browser likely would break or not display at all on another <a href="references.html#ref6">[6]</a>. 
            This led to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) foundation in 1994 to standardize 
            browser requirements and realize the vision of one coherent World Wide Web. </p>
        <p>The W3C formed from a mixture of people from CERN, MIT, and the European Union, but it grew to involve more than 500 companies over time <a href="references.html#ref13">[13]</a>. 
            The W3C's first goal was to outline HTML requirements so that browsers could be designed to display webpages properly and automatically rather than webpages be designed to work only on 
            certain browsers <a href="references.html#ref6">[6]</a>. 
            <br><br>The W3C standardized HTTP, one of the earliest communication protocols used to transmit webpage data and that is still used today. When creating standards, the W3C issues a 
            recommendation, which outlines how a feature should be implemented and defines the rules by which all browsers must operate to adhere to the standard. 
            <br><br>The W3C also creates sample code, 
            offers tools for implementing said standards, and provides assistance to developers with design guides and other materials. The W3C continues to update web standards as needed, most notably
            evolving new standards for web design and accessibility and changing from HTML to XML <a href="references.html#ref13">[13]</a>.
