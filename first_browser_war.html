        <h2>Mainstream Adoption and the First Browser War</h2>
        
        <h3>Bringing the Web to the Average User</h3>
        <p>Around the early- to mid-90’s, the web was seeing significant usage, but still primarily from those in academic or research settings. 
            The catalyst for the beginning of the web’s wider adoption was NCSA Mosaic, a GUI-based browser originally developed for Unix in 1993 [2]. 
            Unlike its recent predecessors, Mosaic displayed images inline, allowing webpages to involve more graphics as part of their core design and be less text-based. 
            Furthermore, Mosaic was quickly ported to Windows, which was the more popular operating systems choice for non-technical users due to its overall user friendliness.<p>
        <p>With the average person now having access to a user-friendly web browser on top of a user-friendly operating system, the web experienced an enormous surge of popularity 
        thanks to Mosaic. Mosaic is considered to be one of the 1990’s “killer applications”—a pivotal piece of software with significant impact on society and subsequent 
        inventions—and was the basis on which later browsers were built upon [2]. Over the next few years, several competing browsers were developed, most notably Netscape’s 
        Navigator in 1994 and Microsoft’s Internet Explorer in 1995.</p>
        
        <h3>The First Browser War</h3>
        <p>As more browser products became available to the general market, the internet gradually became more commercialized. Netscape and Microsoft rapidly took the lead 
            as the main competitors in what would later be known as the first browser war. Their respective products, Navigator and Internet Explorer, provided mostly the 
            same features and introduced support for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) for the first time [4]. During this period, both companies fiercely competed with each other, 
            going as far as to pull publicity stunts to disparage their competition [5]. At first, Netscape obtained the largest market share, but over the next ten years as 
            Microsoft began packaging Internet Explorer into its Windows releases, Microsoft eventually secured 99% of the browser market. Microsoft’s monopoly on the market 
            forced Netscape to pivot, creating Mozilla, which would later lead to the development of Mozilla Firefox [4]. </p>
        
        <h3>The World Wide Web Consortium</h3>
        <p>The competition between so many distinct products was problematic for web users due to each browser using their own versions of HTML and introducing new features 
            that did not necessarily exist in other browsers. While this allowed browsers to stay ahead of one another in the competition, it meant that a webpage that displayed 
            correctly on one browser likely would break or not display at all on another [6]. This led to the World Wide Web Consortium’s (W3C) foundation in 1994 to standardize 
            the web. The goal was to outline requirements for HTML and APIs so that browsers could be designed to display them rather than the other way around [6].</p>
