        <h2>Competing Browsers and the Second Browser War</h2>
        <h3>Competing Monopolies</h3>
        <p>In the early-2000s, browsers became more platform- and operating system-specific. Notably, Microsoft abandoned its attempt to introduce Internet 
            Explorer across multiple operating systems and chose to make it Windows-exclusive to encourage their customers to rely solely on 
            Microsoft products [2]. Macintosh operating systems established Safari as its main browser, which eventually eclipsed most other browser 
            options for that operating system. <br><br>A few other browsers, such as Opera and Lynx, continued to be used by a small percentage of browser users, 
            but the available options were mainly Internet Explorer, Safari, and Firefox [2]. Users had limited ability to choose their preferred browser 
            since many of them were only compatible with one proprietary operating system. Eventually, this would change as companies chose to reintroduce 
            their browser products to other operating systems to attract more customers [2].</p>
        <h3>The Second Browser War</h3>
        <p>A new competitor entered the field in 2008, when Google released Google Chrome to Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. Chrome immediately exploded
            in popularity and Google rapidly obtained a significant share of the market [4]. This marked the beginning of the second browser war,
            which would last for an additional ten years. <br><br>Chrome quickly began competing neck-in-neck with Internet Explorer, with both browsers taking 
            turns holding the dominant market share. Firefox was also a stiff competitor, initially being second behind Internet Explorer but gradually
            slipped behind Google Chrome over time. Eventually, by 2017 Google Chrome secured the largest market share and both Internet Explorer and Firefox 
            lost much of their user base [4].<br><br> Today, Chrome continues to be the most-used browser by far, but Safari, Opera, Firefox, and Microsoft’s new browser 
            Edge continue to see use.</p>
